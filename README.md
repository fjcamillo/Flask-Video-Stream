# Flask Video Stream

-------

In this repository I will be trying to replicate this <a href='https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/video-streaming-with-flask'>tutorial</a> created by  Miguel Grinberg

The main goal is to create a Video Stream Application using Flask that could also receive any camera for the livestream, just by creating your own version of the camera module

Although in the tutorial given, he replaced the whole video part with a continuous streaming image, handled by a generator.
This could be easily solved by just changing and creating your own camera module and replaced the ones we created
